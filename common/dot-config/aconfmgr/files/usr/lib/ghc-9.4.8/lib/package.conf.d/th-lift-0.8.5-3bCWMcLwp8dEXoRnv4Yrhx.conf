synopsis:             Derive Template Haskell's Lift class for datatypes.
description:
    Derive Template Haskell's @Lift@ class for datatypes using @TemplateHaskell@.
    The functionality in this package has largely been subsumed by the
    @DeriveLift@ language extension, which is available in GHC 8.0 and later
    versions. As such, this package is only useful as a way to backport bugfixes
    to @DeriveLift@ in later GHC versions back to older GHCs.

    The following libraries are related:

    * The <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-orphans th-orphans> package
    provides instances for @template-haskell@ syntax types.

    * The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/th-lift-instances th-lift-instances>
    package provides @Lift@ instances for types in @base@, @text@,
    @bytestring@, @vector@, etc. Some of these instances are only provided for
    old versions of their respective libraries, as the same @Lift@ instances
    are also present upstream on newer versions.
