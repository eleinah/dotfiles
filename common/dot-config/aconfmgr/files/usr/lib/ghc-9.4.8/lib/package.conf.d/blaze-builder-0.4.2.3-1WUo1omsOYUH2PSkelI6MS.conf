description:
    This library allows to efficiently serialize Haskell values to lazy bytestrings
    with a large average chunk size. The large average chunk size allows to make
    good use of cache prefetching in later processing steps (e.g. compression) and
    reduces the system call overhead when writing the resulting lazy bytestring to a
    file or sending it over the network.

    This library was inspired by the module Data.Binary.Builder provided by the
    binary package. It was originally developed with the specific needs of the
    blaze-html package in mind. Since then it has been restructured to serve as a
    drop-in replacement for Data.Binary.Builder, which it improves upon both in
    speed as well as expressivity.
