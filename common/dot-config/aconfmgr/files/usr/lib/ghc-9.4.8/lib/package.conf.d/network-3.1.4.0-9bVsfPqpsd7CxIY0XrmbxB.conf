synopsis:             Low-level networking interface
description:
    This package provides a low-level networking interface.

    === High-Level Packages
    Other packages provide higher level interfaces:

    * connection
    * hookup
    * network-simple

    === Extended Packages
    @network@ seeks to provide a cross-platform core for networking. As such some
    APIs live in extended libraries. Packages in the @network@ ecosystem are
    often prefixed with @network-@.

    ==== @network-bsd@
    In @network-3.0.0.0@ the @Network.BSD@ module was split off into its own
    package, @network-bsd-3.0.0.0@.

    ==== @network-uri@
    In @network-2.6@ the @Network.URI@ module was split off into its own package,
    @network-uri-2.6@. If you're using the @Network.URI@ module you can
    automatically get it from the right package by adding this to your @.cabal@
    file:
